# Keypad Lock

This is a simple keypad based lock prototype I made in fourth semester as part of micro-processor and micro-controllers course. It's written entirely in Intel 8051 assembly and utlizes the following :

1. 16x2 parallel LCD module 
2. 4x3 keypad for input
3. Servo motor for lock action
